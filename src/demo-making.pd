$# In this demo I'll show you how to make a demo like this!
$# 
$# You will need the Perfect Demo software. You can get it here:
$# 
$#    https://github.com/ingydotnet/perfect-demo
\ sleep 3
$# 
$# Let's try it out!
\ c

$# First we clone it:
$ git clone https://github.com/ingydotnet/perfect-demo
$# Then we enable it:
$ source perfect-demo/.rc
\ c

$# Now we edit a `.pd` file. I've made one called `cowsay.pd`
$ cat cowsay.pd
\ c

$# Let's run the demo now.
$ time perfect-demo cowsay.pd
\ sleep 1
\ c

$# When it's perfect, we can record it.
$# We need to open up another terminal and run this command:
$ perfect-demo-recorder 5  # Length of time to record...
\ c

$# Now you should have a perfect-demo.gif file
$ ls -l perfect-demo.gif
\ c

$# See https://github.com/ingydotnet/perfect-demo
\ sleep 10
